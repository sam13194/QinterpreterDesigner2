# **App Name**: Quantum Composer

## Core Features:

- Circuit Canvas: A visual grid to represent the quantum circuit, allowing users to drag and drop gates onto specific qubits and time steps.
- Gate Palette: A panel displaying available quantum gates (e.g., H, X, Y, Z, CNOT, Measure) for users to select and drag onto the circuit canvas.
- Bidirectional Conversion: Converts the visual circuit representation to a Qiskit-compatible QuantumCircuit object for simulation, and vice versa.  Ensures compatibility with the classes QuantumCircuit/QuantumGate.
- Circuit Simulation: Simulates the quantum circuit using a Qiskit translator with a default of 1000 shots. Displays the results as a histogram. Generates results suitable for a JSON format.
- JSON Export/Import: Enables users to export the circuit as a JSON file for saving and sharing, and import circuits from JSON files. Retains compatibility with QuantumCircuit and QuantumGate objects.
- AI-Powered Gate Suggestion: Intelligently analyzes the current circuit design and suggests the next most logical gate or sequence of gates to achieve a desired quantum state. The tool may reason about the type of gate required or recommend rearrangement of existing gates for improved performance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark purple (#624CAB) to represent the mystery and depth of quantum mechanics.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222328) to provide a sophisticated and modern feel, creating contrast with brighter elements.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#63B5FF) to highlight interactive elements and important information, contrasting with the primary and background colors.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font for headlines. Body text: 'Inter' sans-serif font for descriptions, parameter values, and labels.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons to represent quantum gates and operations. Highlight when they are active.
- A clear, sectioned layout with a distinct gate palette, circuit canvas, and results display. Incorporate drag-and-drop functionality with clear visual cues.
- Subtle animations and transitions for user interactions, such as gate placement and simulation execution. Ensure animations donâ€™t distract from the core functionality.
